# Task_1-SMS-Classifier
This repository contains code for developing a text classification model to classify SMS messages as either spam or non-spam (ham) using data science techniques in Python.
# Overview
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify SMS messages as spam or non-spam. We'll use various natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to preprocess the text data, extract features, and train a classification model.
# Dataset
The dataset used for this project typically consists of a collection of SMS messages labeled as spam or non-spam. You can find datasets for SMS spam classification on platforms like Kaggle or the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
